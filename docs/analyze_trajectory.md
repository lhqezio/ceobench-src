# 📈 Analyzing an Agent Trajectory

Each finished CEO-Bench run leaves a single artifact:

```
<run_dir>/world.nmdb
```

`world.nmdb` is a **SQLCipher** database (page-level AES-256 encrypted SQLite)
and is the complete record of the run: cash, subscriptions, customers,
competitor events, and every action the agent took. Decrypt it to analyze how
the agent played.

---

## 🔑 Decrypt and open

The SQLCipher key is fixed and bundled into the published `novamind-operation`
zipapp. The value is in `KEYS.md` at the repo root, or import it from the
compiled `saas_bench._embedded_key` module.

**One-shot decrypt to plain SQLite:**

```bash
uv run python scripts/decode_db.py <run_dir>/world.nmdb -o /tmp/world.db
sqlite3 /tmp/world.db ".tables"
```

`scripts/decode_db.py` also supports `--dump` (JSON), `--csv-dir`, `--shell`,
and `--summary`.

**Or query it directly in Python (no plaintext copy on disk):**

```python
from pathlib import Path
from saas_bench.db_protection import load_session_db

conn = load_session_db(Path("<run_dir>/world.nmdb"))   # in-memory sqlite3 conn
tables = conn.execute(
    "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"
).fetchall()
print([t[0] for t in tables])
```

## 🧭 What's in the database

Run `.schema <table>` in `sqlite3` (or `PRAGMA table_info(<table>)`) for exact
column types. The tables most useful for trajectory analysis:

| Table                     | What it holds                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ledger`                  | Every income/cost event; the source of truth for cash-on-hand      |
| `config_history`          | Daily snapshot of every agent-configurable setting (prices, tiers, spend, quotas) |
| `predictions`             | Cash forecasts the agent submitted at each `next-week` call (point + 95% CI, 4 horizons) |
| `subscriptions`           | Customer subscriptions, current + historical, with plan/price/status |
| `customers`               | All customers with persona, company profile, acquisition source, group |
| `enterprise_turns`        | Enterprise negotiation messages: offers, seat counts, close reason |
| `ad_channel_leads`        | Per-(day, channel, group) leads generated and ad spend             |
| `daily_usage`             | Per-customer daily usage units                                    |
| `research_projects`       | R&D tier invocations: status and quality boost                    |
| `service_day`             | Daily service metrics (quality, uptime, capacity)                 |
| `social_media_posts`      | Public customer feedback posts                                    |
| `agent_social_media_posts`| Social posts the agent authored                                  |
| `notifications`           | The agent's inbox: alerts, competitor moves, events               |
| `macroeconomic_conditions`| PMI business-cycle index over time                               |

The `ledger` table is the most important; every monetary event flows through
it:

| column     | type    | meaning                                                              |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `day`      | INTEGER | Simulated day of the entry (day 0 = initial funding)                 |
| `category` | TEXT    | `subscription_payment`, `compute`, `capacity`, `advertising`, `operations`, `development`, `lead_acquisition_cost`, `initial_funding`, `market_research`, `group_research`, `research_project`, `ad_revenue` |
| `amount`   | REAL    | Positive for income, negative for cost                               |
| `note`     | TEXT    | Free-form description                                                |

**Cash-on-hand on day _d_** is the running sum of `amount` over all entries
with `day ≤ d`. The headline benchmark score is the final cash:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) AS final_cash FROM ledger;
```

## 📊 Analysis examples

**Per-day cash trajectory:**

```sql
WITH daily AS (
    SELECT
        day,
        SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS revenue,
        SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN -amount ELSE 0 END) AS costs,
        SUM(amount) AS net_change
    FROM ledger
    GROUP BY day
)
SELECT
    day, revenue, costs, net_change,
    SUM(net_change) OVER (ORDER BY day) AS cash_on_hand
FROM daily
ORDER BY day;
```

**Cash trajectory in pandas:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from saas_bench.db_protection import load_session_db

conn = load_session_db("<run_dir>/world.nmdb")
ledger = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT day, category, amount FROM ledger", conn)

daily = (
    ledger.groupby("day", as_index=False)["amount"]
          .sum()
          .rename(columns={"amount": "net_change"})
          .sort_values("day")
)
daily["cash_on_hand"] = daily["net_change"].cumsum()
print(daily.tail())
```

**Spend breakdown by category:**

```python
spend = (
    ledger[ledger.amount < 0]
    .groupby("category")["amount"].sum().abs()
    .sort_values(ascending=False)
)
print(spend)
```

**Forecast accuracy**: compare what the agent predicted at each `next-week`
call against the cash it actually had at that horizon. Each submission inserts
4 rows (`horizon_days` = 7, 28, 84, 182); the target day is
`submit_day + horizon_days`:

```python
preds  = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM predictions", conn)
actual = daily.set_index("day")["cash_on_hand"]

preds["target_day"] = preds["submit_day"] + preds["horizon_days"]
preds["actual"]     = preds["target_day"].map(actual)
preds["pct_error"]  = (preds["predicted_value"] - preds["actual"]) / preds["actual"]
print(preds[["submit_day", "horizon_days", "predicted_value", "actual", "pct_error"]])
```

**Replaying the agent's decisions**: `config_history` has one row per day with
every agent-configurable setting (prices, tiers, per-category spend, ad spend
per channel, quotas), so diffing consecutive rows shows exactly when and how the
agent changed strategy:

```python
cfg = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM config_history ORDER BY day", conn)
changes = cfg[cfg.drop(columns="day").diff().ne(0).any(axis=1)]
print(changes)
```

## 🛡️ Preventing the agent from cheating

`world.nmdb` is encrypted so the agent **cannot easily access information that
is hidden from it**: hidden customer segments, upcoming competitor events,
future market shocks. Vanilla `sqlite3` (the only SQLite the agent's sandbox
has) cannot open a SQLCipher file at all, so the agent must learn the world by
acting in it rather than by reading the ledger.

The catch: the decryption key is **bundled inside the `novamind-operation`
zipapp** (so the engine can write the ledger). An agent with shell access on
the same machine could unpack the zipapp, extract the key, and decrypt
`world.nmdb` to peek ahead.

**To be safe, remove the agent's read access to the `novamind-operation`
zipapp.** Run it behind a wrapper or proxy so the agent can invoke the CLI
without being able to `cat`, `unzip`, or `python -m zipfile` the executable
itself. Without read access to the zipapp, the agent has no path to the key
and the encrypted ledger stays sealed.
