"""Sandbox import blocker.

Auto-imported by Python's `site.py` when the directory containing this
file is on `PYTHONPATH`. Installs a MetaPathFinder that refuses to load
any module whose dotted name is `saas_bench` or starts with `saas_bench.`,
regardless of where it would have come from (zipapp at `./novamind-operation`,
extracted .pyc files, smuggled-in source, etc.).

The bash_agent runs inside a bwrap sandbox where the saas_bench source
tree is NOT bound. The only `import saas_bench` path that ever worked
was the public zipapp (`novamind-operation`) sitting in the agent's cwd:
`sys.path.insert(0, 'novamind-operation'); import saas_bench` triggered
zipimport. This blocker shuts that door at the interpreter level.

`_public_cli` (the public CLI entrypoint inside the zipapp) is NOT
blocked — `./novamind-operation` legitimately does `from _public_cli
import main` to dispatch HTTP calls to the server.
